XNAT Installer

A package for installing various versions of XNAT.

To use:

    Set XNAT_INSTALLER_DIR to point to the directory containing bin/ and lib/.

    Create a PostgreSQL user with CREATEDB and LOGIN permissions.

    Run as a user with permissions to write to the tomcat webapps directory.  (This could be a user in the tomcat group; see data_dir_group below.)

    Create a build configuration file called config and put it in an otherwise empty directory ($build_dir).

    Run "bin/build $build_dir".

"bin/clean $build_dir" undoes a build, removing the webapp (in $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps), dropping the database, and removing the build and data directories.

The extension schema is included in the build.

In builds of the 1.5 series, parts of .maven are overwritten by JARs from an XNAT-distributed zipfile.

See examples/ for example build configurations.

Build variables may be set in config in the build directory or at the command line.  The build script sources config, so variable declarations must take the form name=value (with no spaces around the "=" and a quoted value if it contains spaces).

The following variables are used and (unless noted) must be definied if they have no default:

    PGHOST -- The database host

    PGUSER -- The database user

    PGPASSWORD -- The password for the database user

    db_name -- The name of the database.  This should not exist (it is created by build and dropped by clean)

    JAVA_HOME -- JAVA_HOME as expected by the XNAT build.  This should contain bin/javac

    xnat_version -- The version of XNAT to install

    TOMCAT_HOME -- TOMCAT_HOME as expected by the XNAT build

    xnat_repo -- The base URL for XNAT source downloads (may start with file:// for a local repository); default ftp://ftp.nrg.wustl.edu/pub/xnat/

    data_dir -- The base directory for XNAT storage (data/, prearchive/, etc).  This is created by build and removed by clean.  The default is $build_dir/data.

    data_dir_group -- The UNIX group for $data_dir and its descendants.  If not given, chgrp is not attempted.

The following variables correspond to values in the build.properties files:

    project_name -- xdat.project.name

    mail_admin -- xdat.admin_email (1.5 series), xdat.mail.admin (1.6 series); default administrator@xnat.org

    mail_prefix -- xdat.mail.prefix (1.6.2, 1.6.3, and 1.6.4)

    require_login -- xdat.require_login; default false

    enable_new_registrations -- xdat.enable_new_registrations; default false

    xnat_url -- xnat.url; default http://localhost:8080/$project_name

    site_title -- xnat.site.title (1.6.5 only)

    security_channel -- xdat.security.channel (1.6 series only); default any

    enable_csrf_token -- xdat.enable_csrf_token (1.6 series only); default true

XNAT Installer has been tested on Ubuntu 14.0.3 LTS with the following 
packages installed:

    tomcat7
    postgresql-9.3
    openjdk-7-jdk
    openjdk-7-jre
